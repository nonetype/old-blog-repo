Qemu 부팅시 emergency mode로 진입해버리는 오류를 고쳐보자.

You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type "journalctl -xb" to view
system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, "systemctl default" or ^D to
try again to boot into default mode.

검색을 통해 [Issue](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/760)를 찾을 수 있었다.
해당 이슈 쓰레드에서 커널 컴파일시 `.config` 파일에서 `CONFIG_CONFIGFS_FS=y` `CONFIG_SECURITYFS=y`로 설정[^issue]하라고 한다.

grep으로 확인해보니 not set 상태여서 아래와 같이 수정해줬다.

```sh
nonetype@pwn:~/linux/linux-4.17$ cat .config | grep "CONFIG_CONFIGFS"
CONFIG_CONFIGFS_FS=y
nonetype@pwn:~/linux/linux-4.17$ cat .config | grep "CONFIG_SECURITYFS"
CONFIG_SECURITYFS=y
nonetype@pwn:~/linux/linux-4.17$
```

`make all -j4` 명령을 통해 다시 컴파일하면 해결된다.
